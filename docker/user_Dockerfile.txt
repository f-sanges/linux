FROM    alpine
RUN     mkdir /tmp/prova_root
RUN     adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' newuser
USER    nobody

docker build -t prova_user .

docker run -it --name c1 prova_user sh

Once you logged in, go to /tmp and check the owners of the files created.
the file /tmp/prova_root will be created as root user
the file /tmp/prova_nobody will be created as nobody (The nobody user is a pseudo user in many Unixes and Linux distributions)
the file /tmp/prova_nobody will be created as newuser

Notice that you are logged in as "newuser" in the container (whoami command inside the container)

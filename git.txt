git remote set-url origin git@github.com:f-sanges/UDEMY_FORKED_Hands_on_Docker_for_JAVA_Developers.git		-> EXAMPLE to change the url of remote

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of use:
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/f-sanges/software_notes.git (fetch)									-> the remotes are set with https
origin  https://github.com/f-sanges/software_notes.git (push)

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:f-sanges/UDEMY_FORKED_Hands_on_Docker_for_JAVA_Developers.git	-> url copied from github ssh url of the repo

$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:f-sanges/UDEMY_FORKED_Hands_on_Docker_for_JAVA_Developers.git (fetch)	-> the remotes are set with ssh
origin  git@github.com:f-sanges/UDEMY_FORKED_Hands_on_Docker_for_JAVA_Developers.git (push)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git-ignore .idea							-> crea il file .ignore valorizzato con .idea 

git log										-> show log commit
git log -1									   show only the last commit, log-NUMBER
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all	   


git show									-> 	is used to view expanded details on Git objects such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits
git show CODE_COMMIT						-> 	git log : show history logs

													Files deleted

												SyncLab@DESKTOP-DLAS36L MINGW64 /d/GitHub/software_notes (master)
												$ git show 8e919c89e
												commit 8e919c89ea5d1e9399f9c9739b623d16f5be9f02
											
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH					-> create and do checkout on NEW_BRANCH
git checkout <COMMIT_SHA>						you can even do checkout to a specific commit retrieved from git log (just for review). Example
												SyncLab@DESKTOP-DLAS36L MINGW64 /d/GitHub/software_notes (master)
												$ git checkout a3afaf07908eba1ebdc63e51c09c354b1bf4cc50
												Note: switching to 'a3afaf07908eba1ebdc63e51c09c354b1bf4cc50'.
												You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
												
git switch <BRANCH>							-> Similar to git checkout <BRANCH>
git switch -c <BRANCH>							Similar to git checkout -b <BRANCH>


git branch									-> show local branches

git branch -r (or -remote)				   	-> show remote branches
git branch -d BRANCH_USED					-> when you are on the master branch, delete the BRANCH_USED locally

git push origin --delete remoteBranchName	-> delete remote branch remoteBranchName
git push origin -u BRANCH_REMOTE				"-u" means upstream. Useful for ex when you create a branch locally and you want to push the branch remotely
	
git merge BRANCH_DEVELOPED					-> when you are on the master branch, merge the BRANCH_DEVELOPED with the main branch


git rm --cached <FILES>						-> Unstage a file; PAY ATTENTION without "cached" the file will be removed

git commit --amend							-> Modify the last commit (for example if i want to change the commit msg or if forgot to add some file to the commit
git commit --amend -m "new commit message" 	   for passing in a new commit message 	
git commit --amend --no-edit				   --no-edit flag will allow you to make the amendment to your commit without changing its commit message

git reset --hard (or -soft) HEAD~1			-> git reset --hard WILL DELETE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY CHANGES. The HEAD~1 means the commit before head.
												Or, you could look at the output of git log, find the commit id of the commit you want to back up to, and then do this:	
												git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>
git reflog									-> The reflog is an ordered list of the commits that HEAD has pointed to	

git pull									-> pulls down from a remote and instantly merges. It's fetch + merge
git pull --all									pulls all the branches, not only the current branch
git pull --rebase								= git fetch + rebase; rebases your local commits ontop of remote HEAD and does not create a merge/merge commit
git fetch									-> git fetch is similar to pull but doesn't merge
git fetch -passing								-p prune, search for deleted branch

git rebase									-> Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
												The primary reason is to maintain a linear project history.
												It allows to "merge" but changing the history of the commit
												DO NOT USE when other dev are using the same branch
git rebase -i HEAD~3						-> rebase interactive mode, HEAD-NUMBER_OF_COMMIT, in the textpad put "s" instead of "pick" to squash commits
git push --force-with-lease					-> after a commit squash t force origin to be aligned with master
												--force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing
												
												
git clone REMOTE_REPO DIRECTORY				-> Clone the repo in the directory specified												
git clone -b <branchname> <remote-repo-url>	-> Clone the repository, fetch all branches, and checkout to a specific branch immediately.

git ls-files								-> Show information about files in the index and the working tree
git ls-tree -r BRANCH --name-only			-> list all files for a specific branch; -r recursive

git mv FILE1 FILE2							-> Rename or move a file tracking the operation
git rm FILE1								-> Remove a file tracking the operation	


git add -A 									-> For git 2.x same behaviour of "git add ."	

git diff									-> Diff between the HEAD(last commit) and changes not committed yet	

git mergetool								-> Open a tool to help merging		

GITHUB close issue with commit				-> You can use any of these keywords to close an issue via commit message: close, closes, closed, fixes, fixed:
												Example: git commit -m “Fixes #4” will close issue number 4
											   To associate an issue already closed to a commit use the comment on the commit
												for example commenting like "associate with #3" will associate the commit with the 3rd issue
